# Teach Kids To Code

A list of resources to teach kids how to code, with my personal thoughts of them.

This repo is intended as part of my research on how to make [GIRLsmarts4tech](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/girlsmarts4tech/)'s programming activity better.

## Platforms

### [Apple Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/ca/swift/playgrounds/) on iPad

I did Learn to Code 1 (Swift 3.1): Commands, Functions, For Loops.

#### Pros

- Engaging, fun and interactive
- Useful stepper
- Easy to drag and drop
- Built-in glossary

#### Cons

- Challenging: I find it fairly challenging, especially pattern-finding
- Hard to type on tablets
- Really slow to tap commands: after each tap the panel will disappear for ~1 second and reappear
- Really slow to run code: compile Swift code in real time I'm assuming
- Maybe too much text for kids
- Device constraint - only on iPads

#### [Support](https://developer.apple.com/support/swift-playgrounds/)

- Fairly frequent updates: their [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/release-notes/)
- [Teachers Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-playgrounds-learn-to/id1118578018?mt=11) available for the two built-in lessons - Learn to Code 1 & 2
- Official support seems to be offered only on general Swift discussion forums

#### [Apple + Code.org](https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/code/)

While researching I found that in 2016, Apple partnered up with [Code.org](code.org) to host in-store, hour-long coding sessions from December 5-11, which was during the [Computer Science Education Week](https://csedweek.org/). Not sure if they will do this again this year (2017).
