# Teach Kids To Code

A list of resources that teach kids to code, with my personal thoughts of them.

This repo is intended as part of my research on how to make [GIRLsmarts4tech](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/girlsmarts4tech/)'s programming activity better. If are curious about what we do in the end, I wrote a blog post about it: [Redesign GIRLsmarts4techâ€™s Programming Activity](http://www.mandychen.me/blog/redesign-girlsmarts4tech-programming-activity).

## Topics

- Commands
- Functions
- For Loops (Apple Hour of Code taught these three)
- Conditionals
- Logical Operators
- While Loops
- Algorithms
- Variables
- Types

## [Apple Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/ca/swift/playgrounds/)

It's an app on iPad that teaches coding in Swift.

I did Learn to Code 1 (Swift 3.1): Commands, Functions, For Loops.

General impression of it is that it moves fast, so it's probably more suitable for older kids.

### Pros

- Free
- Engaging, fun and interactive
- Jump right in with Swift syntax
- Teach Swift, which is an actual programming language
- Cover a wide range of fundamental topics
- Useful stepper
- Easy to drag and drop
- Built-in glossary

### Cons

- Challenging: I find it fairly challenging, especially pattern-finding
- Hard to type on tablets
- Really slow to tap commands: after each tap the panel will disappear for ~1 second and reappear
- Really slow to run code: compile Swift code in real time I'm assuming
- Maybe too much text for kids
- Device constraint - only on iPads

### [Support](https://developer.apple.com/support/swift-playgrounds/)

- Fairly frequent updates: their [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/release-notes/)
- [Teachers Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-playgrounds-learn-to/id1118578018?mt=11) available for the two built-in lessons - Learn to Code 1 & 2
- Official support seems to be offered only on general Swift discussion forums

### [Apple + Code.org](https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/code/)

While researching I found that in 2016, Apple partnered up with [Code.org](code.org) to host in-store, hour-long coding sessions from December 5-11, which was during the [Computer Science Education Week](https://csedweek.org/). Not sure if they will do this again this year (2017).

## [Code Monkey](https://www.playcodemonkey.com)

It's website/game that teaches coding in CoffeeScript.

I did Challenge 1-12.

General impression is that it moves fairly slowly. I don't know where CoffeeScript actually starts to strike in, but the first few challenges have just pseudocode.

### Pros

There is nothing too special about Code Monkey.

### Cons

- Not free if you want the full game
- Move fairly slowly: you can't skip easier challenges
- More math in the beginning: lots of step and angle measurements
- Not explaining programming concepts

## [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

I don't think there is too much space for us (GIRLsmarts4tech) to build on Scratch if a lot of kids have used Scratch in school.

Personally I feel after the kids have some level of familiarity with the Scratch syntax, you can't really move them out of the blocks.

## [Scratch to JavaScript](http://s2js.com/)

It's a website that teaches JavaScript coding to kids who have programmed in Scratch.

I went through Section 1 (Introduction to HTML, Introduction to drawing on the canvas, Control: functions, loops, if-then-else, Randomness and numbers), and Section 2 (Making Sprites move, Responding to keys, A First Game).

### Pros

- From Scratch to JavaScript: coming from Scratch to a more practical programming language

### Cons

- Not so interactive: the transition to JavaScript is done fairly fast by teaching them how to draw on a canvas, although they do move on to make a game later
